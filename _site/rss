<title>MacOS quick action to save active tab as shortcut</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>When I want to save a shortcut to a website in a folder in Finder, I had an awkward workflow to position the Finder window and browser window such that I could drag the icon from the nav bar into the Finder window. To make this simpler, I created a quick action in Automator.</p>

<title>My first few days with C</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>This week I started relearning C. I used C++ for a year in college and about a decade ago I worked on a microcontroller project in C, but my familiarity with C is fairly rusty. I picked up a copy of K&amp;R and started by reading the first few chapters and doing the exercises in a text editor and compiling with gcc.</p>

<title>Knuth's prime algorithm</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>For several years I’ve intended to check out Donald Knuth’s <em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>. I finally picked up a copy and hopefully I won’t regret it. I’ve been programming for well over a decade, but had very little formal computer science education (only Algorithms 101). Knuth’s book aims to lay down a mathematical foundation for programming. He’s been releasing new volumes for over 50 years. I didn’t realize how encyclopedic this book was until I flipped through it.</p>

<title>Stack operations in F#</title>
<description><![CDATA[<p>In this post, I'm going to combine some linear list concepts from <em>The Art of Programming</em> with my recent introduction to F# and immutable programming. Section 2.2.1 covers various types of singly linked list structures. I'm going to implement a few of these operations in F#.</p>
